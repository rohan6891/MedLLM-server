Symptoms include intense pain that worsens with movement, swelling around the injury, bruising, deformity (like an unnatural bend), and difficulty moving the affected limb. Some fractures cause a grinding sensation or visible bone protrusion in open fractures. Treatment depends on the fracture\u2019s severity: simple fractures may heal with a cast or splint to immobilize the bone for 4\u20138 weeks, while complex fractures may require surgery with plates, screws, or rods to align bones properly. Healing time varies\u2014children heal faster than adults\u2014and physical therapy often aids recovery by restoring strength and mobility. Complications like infections or poor healing are rare but serious. To prevent fractures, maintain strong bones with a diet rich in calcium (milk, yogurt) and vitamin D (sunlight, supplements), engage in weight-bearing exercises like walking, and reduce fall risks by clearing home hazards, using handrails, and wearing supportive shoes. Regular bone density checks are vital for older adults to catch weaknesses early.",

    "text": "Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances like pollen, dust mites, pet dander, foods (nuts, shellfish), or medications, triggering a range of symptoms. Mild symptoms include sneezing, runny or stuffy nose, itchy/watery eyes, hives, or skin rashes, while severe cases may cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction with breathing difficulties, swelling, or throat closure, requiring immediate care. Causes involve genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, or immune dysfunction, with triggers varying widely (e.g., seasonal pollen, mold). Treatment includes antihistamines (cetirizine) for relief, nasal corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis, and epinephrine auto-injectors (EpiPen) for emergencies. Immunotherapy (allergy shots) reduces sensitivity over years. Avoidance is key: use air purifiers, wash bedding in hot water, and check food labels. Untreated allergies can worsen asthma or cause sinus infections. Prevention involves minimizing allergen exposure (closing windows, regular cleaning), breastfeeding infants for immunity, and early allergen testing. Regular allergist visits and emergency preparedness (carrying EpiPens) improve safety, reducing symptom severity and enhancing quality of life, especially for children or those with severe reactions.",

    "text": "Migraines are severe, throbbing headaches, often unilateral, lasting 4\u201372 hours, significantly disrupting daily life. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sound, or smells, and aura (visual disturbances like flashing lights or tingling) in some cases. Triggers vary: stress, hormonal changes (menstruation, menopause), sleep disruptions, caffeine, alcohol, or foods (chocolate, MSG). Causes may involve genetics, brain chemical imbalances, or vascular changes. Treatment uses over-the-counter pain relievers (ibuprofen) for mild attacks, triptans (sumatriptan) or CGRP inhibitors for severe cases, and anti-nausea drugs. Preventive medications (beta-blockers, antidepressants) reduce frequency for chronic migraines. Lifestyle changes\u2014consistent sleep (7\u20138 hours), hydration, stress management (yoga, meditation), and avoiding triggers\u2014minimize attacks. A headache diary tracks patterns, aiding management. Untreated migraines can lead to chronic pain or medication overuse headaches. Prevention includes routine schedules and trigger avoidance. Neurologist consultations ensure tailored plans, and techniques like biofeedback or acupuncture may help. Regular monitoring and early intervention reduce migraine frequency and severity, improving work, social life, and overall well-being for sufferers.",

    "text": "Thyroid disorders disrupt the thyroid gland\u2019s hormone production, affecting metabolism, energy, and organ function. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) causes fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, hair loss, constipation, cold intolerance, and depression due to low hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) leads to weight loss, anxiety, rapid heartbeat, sweating, heat intolerance, and tremors. Symptoms may include goiter (neck swelling), irregular periods, or mood swings. Causes include autoimmune diseases (Hashimoto\u2019s for hypothyroidism, Graves\u2019 for hyperthyroidism), iodine deficiency, thyroiditis, or nodules. Diagnosis uses blood tests (TSH, T4 levels) and imaging (ultrasound). Treatment for hypothyroidism involves levothyroxine to replace hormones; hyperthyroidism uses antithyroid drugs (methimazole), radioactive iodine to shrink the gland, or surgery. Regular monitoring adjusts dosing. Untreated disorders risk heart issues, infertility, or osteoporosis. Prevention includes adequate iodine (seafood, iodized salt), stress management, and avoiding excessive soy. Regular checkups, especially with family history, catch issues early. Dietary adjustments and support groups improve energy, mood, and health, ensuring stable hormone levels with consistent medical care.",

    "text": "Osteoporosis weakens bones, making them brittle and prone to fractures, particularly in the hips, spine, and wrists, and is common in older adults, especially postmenopausal women due to estrogen decline. Symptoms are often absent until a fracture occurs, though some experience back pain, height loss, or stooped posture. Causes include aging, low calcium/vitamin D intake, inactivity, smoking, excessive alcohol, long-term steroid use, or hormonal disorders. Treatment uses bisphosphonates (alendronate) to slow bone loss, calcium (1200 mg daily), vitamin D supplements, and weight-bearing exercises (walking, strength training) to improve density. Balance exercises (tai chi) reduce fall risks. Untreated osteoporosis can cause chronic pain, disability, or spinal deformities. Prevention involves a bone-healthy diet (dairy, greens), regular exercise, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol. Bone density scans (DXA) monitor risks in those over 65. Fall-proofing homes (grab bars, non-slip mats) and regular checkups maintain mobility, preventing fractures and supporting independence with proactive care.",

Symptoms include productive cough (mucus or phlegm), high fever, chills, chest pain (worsened by breathing), shortness of breath, fatigue, and confusion, particularly in older adults. Bacterial pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae) is common, while viral cases often follow flu. Risk factors include smoking, chronic conditions (COPD, diabetes), weakened immunity, or recent respiratory infections. Treatment depends on cause: antibiotics (azithromycin) for bacterial, antivirals for some viral cases, and rest/fluids for recovery. Severe cases need hospitalization for oxygen or IV fluids. Complications include sepsis, lung abscesses, or respiratory failure. Prevention involves pneumococcal/flu vaccinations, quitting smoking, and hygiene (handwashing). Healthy diets and exercise boost immunity. Patients must complete treatments to avoid relapse. Regular checkups, especially for high-risk groups, ensure early intervention, reducing recovery time and preventing severe outcomes, particularly in children or the elderly.",

    "text": "Kidney stones are hard mineral deposits (calcium, uric acid) forming in the kidneys, causing severe pain when passing through the urinary tract. Symptoms include sharp, cramping pain in the back, side, or lower abdomen, blood in urine (pink/red), nausea, vomiting, frequent/painful urination, or fever if infected. Causes include dehydration, high-sodium/protein diets, obesity, genetics, or conditions like gout or hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis uses urine tests, imaging (CT, ultrasound), or stone analysis. Treatment involves pain relievers (NSAIDs), hydration (2\u20133 liters daily) to flush small stones, and medications (tamsulosin) to aid passage. Large stones require lithotripsy (sound waves) or surgery (ureteroscopy). Untreated stones risk infections or kidney damage. Prevention includes ample water intake, low-sodium/oxalate diets (avoid spinach, nuts), and calcium-rich foods to bind oxalates. Regular checkups and urine analysis monitor recurrence (50% risk). Dietary changes and hydration reduce stone formation, improving kidney function and comfort with consistent management.",

    "text": "Gallstones, or cholelithiasis, are hardened deposits of bile, typically cholesterol or bilirubin, forming in the gallbladder, which stores bile to aid fat digestion. Symptoms include sudden, intense pain in the upper right abdomen or center, often after meals, lasting minutes to hours, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, or jaundice (yellow skin/eyes) if stones block bile ducts. Many gallstones are asymptomatic until a blockage occurs, detected incidentally during imaging. Causes include high-cholesterol or high-fat diets, obesity, rapid weight loss, diabetes, genetics, or being female, with higher risks in older adults, Native Americans, and Mexican Americans. Diagnosis relies on ultrasound or CT scans, sometimes blood tests for infection or jaundice. Treatment often involves laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a minimally invasive surgery to remove the gallbladder, with quick recovery. Medications like ursodiol may dissolve small stones over months, though less common. Untreated gallstones can cause complications like gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis), infections, or pancreatitis. Prevention includes a low-fat, high-fiber diet (vegetables, whole grains), gradual weight loss, and regular exercise (30 minutes most days). Regular checkups detect stones early, especially in high-risk groups. Post-surgery, most resume normal diets, but some avoid fatty foods to prevent diarrhea. Consistent dietary habits and monitoring maintain digestive health, reducing recurrence risks.",

Symptoms include intense itching (worse at night), redness, swelling, dry or scaly skin, small bumps that may leak fluid, and crusting or oozing sores from scratching. It\u2019s most common in babies and children, often starting before age 5, but can persist or appear in adults. The cause is unknown but involves genetics (family history of allergies or asthma), environmental triggers, and a weakened skin barrier lacking proteins to retain moisture. Diagnosis is based on physical exams and medical history, with skin or blood tests to rule out other conditions. Treatment focuses on symptom relief: moisturizers (ceramide-based) hydrate skin, topical corticosteroids (hydrocortisone) reduce inflammation, and antihistamines ease itching. Severe cases may use phototherapy or oral immunosuppressants. Avoiding triggers\u2014harsh soaps, wool fabrics, pollen, stress\u2014is crucial. Complications include skin infections, asthma, or hay fever. Prevention involves daily moisturizing, gentle skincare, humidifiers, and stress management.

Symptoms include uncontrollable anxious thoughts, restlessness, tension, fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension, sleep disturbances, and physical signs like rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, dizziness, shortness of breath, or nausea. Types include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD, excessive worry for \u22656 months), Panic Disorder (sudden panic attacks), and Phobias (intense fear of specific objects/situations). Causes are unclear but involve genetics, brain chemistry, stress, traumatic events, or personality traits (e.g., shyness). Diagnosis includes a medical history review, physical exam, lab tests to exclude other conditions, and psychological evaluation, often by a mental health professional. Treatment combines psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) and medications (SSRIs like sertraline, anti-anxiety drugs). Stress management (mindfulness, relaxation) and support groups help. Complications include depression or reduced quality of life. While prevention is limited, stress reduction and early intervention mitigate risks. Regular mental health checkups and avoiding caffeine/substances improve outcomes, helping patients regain control and enhance well-being.",
